Ruby JSON RPC Client for Go RPC Servers

The gonit daemon serves its API over the standard net/rpc go package.
Existing Ruby json rpc clients do not support unix sockets, afaict.

Go's json rpc implementation may not be compatible with existing clients in any
case; rsc on json rpc:

  `It's not a standard.  It's a web page some guy wrote,
   and it's not terribly fleshed out.' [1]

This module is currently generic, but may become gonit specific in the future.

While gonit and this client can talk over a TCP connection, such use is
discouraged as the connection is not authenticated.  If you tinker with TCP, it
should only be to localhost, in which case no connect timeouts are needed.

File based permissions can be used for unix socket connections.
