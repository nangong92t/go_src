At SmartyStreets we find GoConvey to be wonderfully useful and have declared the project "feature-complete" as it currently stands and so other projects are crowding in. Having said that, we welcome contributions, especially fixes to incorrect behavior (ok I'll admit it, there are some bugs...).

You can track the progress of known issues on our public [Trello](https://trello.com/b/hM7xVauQ/goconvey) board. If you'd like to see a new feature included or have a bug report, please send an email to [goconvey@smartystreets.com](goconvey@smartystreets.com).
